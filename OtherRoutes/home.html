        If you’re eager to step into the exciting world of web development, then this HTML course is the perfect place
        to start. HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the foundational language used to create and structure web
        pages. It allows you to design and display content on the web, like text, images, links, and multimedia, with
        ease and flexibility.
        <br>
        In this course, you'll start with the very basics of HTML, learning how to set up and organize your web page’s
        structure. As you progress, you’ll explore more advanced elements like forms, tables, and media embedding, which
        bring a dynamic touch to your sites. We’ll cover essential tags and attributes, and you’ll learn best practices
        for clean, accessible code that loads efficiently across devices.
        <br>
        This course is designed for beginners, with step-by-step instructions, engaging examples, and practical
        exercises that make learning both fun and effective. By the end, you’ll be able to confidently create web pages
        that showcase your unique content and ideas.
        <br>
        So, whether you're pursuing web development as a hobby, preparing for a career in tech, or simply curious about
        how the internet works, W3University’s HTML course is your gateway to becoming a skilled web creator. Let’s get
        started on your HTML journey!

    <div class="hDescription">
        HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the fundamental building block of the web, used to structure and present
        content on the internet. Its evolution traces back to the late 1980s, with a need to create a universal system
        for sharing documents across diverse computer systems.
        <br>
        In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee, a physicist and computer scientist working at CERN (the European Organization for
        Nuclear Research), proposed a new project to manage and share information seamlessly between scientists around
        the world. He envisioned a system that could link documents in a non-linear format, allowing users to jump
        between documents through hyperlinks. By 1991, he had created the first version of HTML, along with the HTTP
        protocol and the first web browser, called **WorldWideWeb**.
        <br>
        HTML 1.0, the earliest version of HTML, was very basic by modern standards. It included only a limited number of
        tags, enough to create simple web pages with headings, paragraphs, lists, and links. Over the next few years,
        HTML’s capabilities expanded rapidly as the web gained popularity and the demand for more sophisticated designs
        and functionality grew.
        <br>
        In 1995, **HTML 2.0** was released by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). This version formalized many
        of the tags and attributes that had emerged, setting a standard for creating basic interactive and graphical
        content. However, as commercial interest in the web exploded, browser developers like Netscape and Microsoft
        began adding their own proprietary tags and features, which led to fragmentation. To address this, the **World
        Wide Web Consortium (W3C)** was established in 1994, led by Tim Berners-Lee. W3C aimed to standardize HTML,
        ensuring that web pages could work consistently across all browsers.
        <br>
        HTML 3.2, released by W3C in 1997, standardized some of the tags introduced by browsers, like tables and complex
        forms. It enabled more visually appealing web pages with the inclusion of various formatting and styling
        options. However, as demands for even richer content grew, HTML 4.0 was introduced in 1999. This version was a
        significant milestone, as it supported internationalization, multimedia elements, and accessibility features,
        laying the groundwork for today’s global, multimedia-rich web.
        <br>
        In the early 2000s, as the web evolved, the limitations of HTML 4.0 became apparent. There was a push for more
        interactive, app-like experiences, which HTML alone couldn’t fully support. This need led to the development of
        **XHTML (Extensible HyperText Markup Language)**, a stricter, XML-based version of HTML, intended to bring
        greater structure and consistency. However, XHTML’s rigid syntax requirements proved challenging for developers,
        and its adoption was limited.
        <br>
        In response, W3C and a new organization, the **Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG)**,
        began working together to create a more flexible and powerful version of HTML. The result was **HTML5**, first
        released in 2008 and fully standardized in 2014. HTML5 introduced new elements for audio, video, graphics
        (through the &lt;canvas&gt; tag), and more semantic tags like &lt;article&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, and
        &lt;header&gt;, enabling richer, more structured content. HTML5 also supported APIs for advanced web
        applications, which made it possible to create interactive and media-rich experiences directly in the browser,
        without relying on plugins like Flash or Silverlight.
        <br>
        Today, HTML continues to evolve, with HTML5 serving as the backbone of the modern web. Regular updates from the
        W3C and WHATWG keep it in line with technological advancements, ensuring that HTML remains robust and adaptable.
        From its origins as a basic document-sharing language to its role as the backbone of interactive web
        applications, HTML’s journey reflects the rapid growth and innovation of the internet itself. Its evolution has
        empowered developers to create dynamic, accessible, and visually engaging experiences, making it an
        indispensable part of the digital landscape.
